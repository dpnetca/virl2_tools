# VIRL^2 Tools and Scripts

Building a library to store a collection of tools for working with VIRL<sup>2</sup>

These tools will leverage a combination of the VIRL<sup>2</sup> API's and the
VIRL<sup>2</sup> python client.

In order for this to work you must download and install the virl2_client 
library from your virl<sup>2</sup> server.

NOTE: This is pretty empty for now, but intend to add to it over time
